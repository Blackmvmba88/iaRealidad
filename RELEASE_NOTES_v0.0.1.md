# Release v0.0.1 - "El Despertar" (The Awakening)

**Release Date:** January 11, 2026

---

## 🎉 The First Release

This is the inaugural release of **iaRealidad** - the moment when the project transitions from code to history, from development to identity.

> *"Aquí es donde empezó la expansión."*  
> *"Here is where the expansion began."*

This isn't just a v0.0.1 - it's a statement of identity. This is software that **narrates**, not just executes. This is code that will be **collected**, not just compiled.

## 🌟 What is iaRealidad?

**iaRealidad** is a revolutionary cross-platform AR (Augmented Reality) assistant for electronics repair, measurement, and creation. It transforms your mobile device into an intelligent repair companion that:

- **Sees** circuit boards and identifies components in real-time
- **Listens** to electrical noise and mechanical sounds to detect problems
- **Understands** failure patterns and recommends intelligent repairs
- **Guides** you through measurements, repairs, and module installations
- **Learns** from every repair to continuously improve diagnostics

## 💡 Philosophy

This project embodies a unique approach to software development:

> **"Hay software que se codifica… y software que se narra."**  
> *"There is software that is coded... and software that is narrated."*

When you code with intention, document with care, and build with vision - you create more than a tool. You create **history**. You create **identity**. You create something worth **collecting**.

This is software that will be remembered not for what it fixed, but for **what it became**.

---

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Built with passion, poetry, and precision.

This release marks the moment when **iaRealidad** left the workshop and entered the world.

Special recognition to all who believed in the vision of democratizing electronics knowledge through AR and AI.
